Welcome to my interactive portfolio site! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m a big space nerd, inspired by creations like *The Expanse*, *For All Mankind*, *The Three-Body Problem*, and *Project Hail Mary*. Currently, Iâ€™m reading the *Bobiverse* series, where Bob, a software engineer, explores the universe as a spaceship. This sparked an idea: while I was born too early to explore the stars, I can create a universe of my own.

This portfolio is an extension of my identity. You pilot a spaceship to explore star systems, each representing a section of my lifeâ€”work experience, projects, travels, and more. Itâ€™s interactive, inspired by sites like [bruno-simon.com](https://bruno-simon.com).

### Features

- Explore star systems representing different aspects of my portfolio.
- Interactive spaceship navigation.
- Plans for procedurally generated pixel graphics and on-device LLM-generated stories.
- Future addition of Cylon Raiders (from Battlestar Galactica) for some fun in-between explorations.
