                        <p>"To say Tirtha exceeded every challenge I gave him would be an understatement. I hired Tirtha as a front end developer, primarily to contribute to our React codebase. Tirtha implemented UI's faithful to designs and designed his own intuitive interfaces. He created rock-solid Typescript code that implemented OAuth, secured sensitive APIs, and built interfaces to other internal systems. As priorities changed, Tirtha volunteered to contribute to a Ruby on Rails app that no one on staff had much experience with, contributed to inherited .Net 4 C# ASP.net MVC solutions, and fully architected a cloud native Python app to assist with customer support functions. Whenever there was code that absolutely HAD to work well, I trusted Tirtha. When there was code that needed to be turned around fast, I trusted Tirtha. Tirtha is the kind of developer that makes a good IT team a GREAT one."</p>
