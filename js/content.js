                        <p>In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function retains access to its lexical scope, even when executed outside of that scope. In React, closures often appear in event handlers, effects, and asynchronous operations. However, due to React's rendering behavior, these closures can sometimes capture stale state or props, leading to bugs.</p>

                        <p>Rendering extensive lists (e.g., 10,000 items) by creating a DOM node for each item can severely impact performance. Even dynamically adding and removing nodes during scrolling can lead to lag due to the heavy nature of DOM operations and unpredictable user scroll behavior.

                        <p>Imagine you have six images on your home page. You might proceed with loading the images separately. After all, they are six different images and to be used in six different places. And you might be right ... from your perspective. You also know that loading six different images will force the browser to make six different HTTP requests to the server. And each time it makes a request, a few milliseconds gets added to your page loading time. That's bad news if you have fifty images.</p>

                        <p>"To say Tirtha exceeded every challenge I gave him would be an understatement. I hired Tirtha as a front end developer, primarily to contribute to our React codebase. Tirtha implemented UI's faithful to designs and designed his own intuitive interfaces. He created rock-solid Typescript code that implemented OAuth, secured sensitive APIs, and built interfaces to other internal systems. As priorities changed, Tirtha volunteered to contribute to a Ruby on Rails app that no one on staff had much experience with, contributed to inherited .Net 4 C# ASP.net MVC solutions, and fully architected a cloud native Python app to assist with customer support functions. Whenever there was code that absolutely HAD to work well, I trusted Tirtha. When there was code that needed to be turned around fast, I trusted Tirtha. Tirtha is the kind of developer that makes a good IT team a GREAT one."</p>
